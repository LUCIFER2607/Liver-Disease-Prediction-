Disease Predictor is a web-based system that predicts a user's disease based on the symptoms they have. Data sets from various health-related websites have been obtained for the Disease Prediction system. The consumer will be able to determine the likelihood of a disease based on the symptoms given using Disease Predictor. People are always curious to learn new things, particularly as the use of the internet grows every day. When an issue occurs, people often want to look it up on the internet. Hospitals and physicians have less access to the internet than the general public. When people are afflicted with an illness, they do not have many options. As a result, this system can be beneficial to people.

Chronic diseases affect one-third of the population worldwide due to the changing lifestyle and are a costly and challenging issue to manage. The medical field has collected vast amounts of data on chronic diseases, and data mining can help with early detection. 

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It is an ensemble learning technique that creates multiple decision trees and aggregates their results to make predictions.

To create a random forest, the algorithm randomly selects a subset of features and a subset of data samples from the training set to create each decision tree. The algorithm then trains each decision tree on its respective subset of data and features.

When making a prediction, the random forest algorithm aggregates the predictions of all the individual trees to produce a final prediction. This aggregation process helps to reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the overall accuracy of the model.

Random Forest is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional datasets, handle missing data, and handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.
